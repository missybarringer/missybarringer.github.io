                <p>Always be ready to learn and try to learn something new every day is my belief. The bootcamp is a new an exciting challenge in my 
                life, I believe change is good and keeps it interesting.
                The last year has been full of changes. I've taken some time to learn more about surface design 
                (i.e. fabric, wallpaper, gift wrap, etc) and hone my Illustrator skills.</p>
                <p>But, coding for a living has always been a dream as well, so combining the two seemed a logical choice when the opportunity to get 
                accepted into the Full Stack Bootcamp at Vanderbilt. As a previous project manager for a local laboratory software company, I found that the 
                part of the software implementaions that I enjoyed the most was working on the web portals that were often purchased with the software. These 
                were complex cache server pages (csp) that I deployed by copying, cutting and pasting and modified based on the client's requests. I 
                never fully understood the code and often broke more things than I fixed so the backend developers would have to come in to save the day.</p>
                <p>Challenging myself has taken me down many different career paths, such as nursing, perfusion, implementations analyst, front-end web developer,
                and project manager. My past careers have given me a diverse and unique background that fits well into healthcare informatics, which is the 
                path that I'd like to pursue after this 6 month bootcamp.</p>
                <p>Just some fun stuff: We live on a 10 acre farm called Goat Feather Farm with goats, chickens, dogs, cats, and a horse. We sell our goat's milk
                to a local farm MaBella who makes goats milk soap which is sold online, at a store-front in Eagleville, and at many local groceries around town.</p>
