## About
*[This is my published website](https://missybarringer.github.io/)
*My goal after graduation would be to become a Full-Stack developer for a
local technical company.
*Creativity and pushing the envelope is a passion that has driven me to pursue a Full-Stack development career 
using the latest technologies. Core concepts in JavaScript, jQuery, Node, Firebase, databases, React, 
and Java were some of the technologies learned during Vanderbilt's bootcamp.
